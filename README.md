# Magnet Handlers

## Project Description

This project is an **Online Magnet Shop** specializing in magnets designed for water retrieval, commonly used for magnet fishing. Users can browse, search, and purchase high-strength magnets intended for underwater exploration and treasure hunting. The platform is built to offer a user-friendly experience with fast navigation and reliable performance.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: We use React for building the frontend, ensuring a fast, interactive, and dynamic user experience.
- **PNPM**: PNPM is our package manager of choice for its speed and efficiency in managing dependencies, resulting in faster builds and easier management of shared dependencies.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the user interface.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: The primary programming language for business logic and interaction handling.
- **API**: We integrate with a backend API for data handling and business logic.
